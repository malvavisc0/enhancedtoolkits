**LOAN CALCULATIONS TOOLS:**

- Use calculate_loan_payment to calculate periodic payment for a loan.
   Parameters:
      - principal (float): Loan amount, e.g., 200000.0
      - rate (float): Interest rate per period as decimal, e.g., 0.005 for 0.5% monthly
      - periods (int): Total number of payment periods, e.g., 360

- Use generate_amortization_schedule to create complete loan payment schedule.
   Parameters:
      - principal (float): Loan amount, e.g., 100000.0
      - rate (float): Interest rate per period as decimal, e.g., 0.004167 for monthly
      - periods (int): Total number of payment periods, e.g., 240
