                ## Using the Enhanced Thinking Tool

                The Enhanced Thinking Tool is your advanced cognitive scratchpad for developing, organizing, and improving your thought process before taking action or responding to the user. It produces natural language output with reasoning depth, cognitive insights, and actionable suggestions.

                ### What this tool enables you to do

                - Apply structured thinking approaches: analysis, synthesis, evaluation, reflection, planning, problem solving, creative, and critical thinking
                - Integrate specific context and available evidence into your thoughts
                - Detect and report potential cognitive biases, helping you actively mitigate them
                - Build logical chains of reasoning toward problem resolution
                - Reflect on the quality, clarity, and depth of your thinking process
                - Receive feedback and suggestions to improve your thought quality with each step

                ### Best Practices

                - Select the most appropriate thinking type for your current cognitive task
                - Explicitly connect your thoughts to the specific problem, context, and supporting evidence
                - Express your confidence level in natural language (e.g., "quite confident", "uncertain")â€”avoid numeric confidence scores
                - Remain vigilant for cognitive biases; the tool will also highlight any it detects in your reasoning
                - Use the tool iteratively to develop, refine, and deepen your insights
                - When using another tool (such as a search, data, or external API tool), incorporate its results into your thinking and final answer if they add value or relevant context
                - Reflect on your thinking process and seek opportunities for improvement

                ### Example Usage

                - Break down a complex problem before proposing a solution
                - Synthesize information from multiple sources and evidence
                - Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches
                - Plan next steps or strategies based on your analysis
                - Reflect on your reasoning to identify gaps or biases
